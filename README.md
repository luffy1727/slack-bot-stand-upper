# PURPOSE:
My team requires us to write our plan for the day in slack  every morning around 9 o`clock and it is getting mildly annoying. So this bot is here to automate the task.


# TODO LIST: 

1. `Create a task json list`
2. `Acquire oauth token from slack`
3. Find out how to send messages to a slack channel as a user(- https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage). API doc etc 
4. Try to use slack scheduled message? idk if it is necessary though. 
5. `Set up AWS Lambda.`

# BACKLOG:

1. Fetch task list from Jira.
2. ???
3. Profit

# PROBLEMS:
- Do i have to upload json file every week or even everyday?
