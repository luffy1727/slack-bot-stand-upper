# PURPOSE:
My team requires us to write our plan for the day in slack  every morning around 9 o`clock and it is getting mildly annoying. So this bot is here to automate the task.

# TODO LIST:
- [x] `Create a task json list`
- [x] `Acquire oauth token from slack`
- [x] Find out how to send messages to a slack channel as a user(- https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage). API doc etc 
- [x] Try to use slack scheduled message? idk if it is necessary though. 
- [x] `Fetch task list from Jira/Phabricator?.`
- [x] `Set up AWS Lambda.`
- [ ] `Add date checker? (if tuesday or thursday add WFH at the end.)`
